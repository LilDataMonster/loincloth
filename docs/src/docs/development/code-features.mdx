## Introduction

[LDM-LIB](https://github.com/LilDataMonster/ldm-lib/) provides system support with ESP-IDF as a wrapper to many of the Espressif core library calls. [LDM-Sensor](https://github.com/LilDataMonster/ldm-sensors) provides sensor support to initialize and read/generate data from any sensors.

## LDM-LIB Feature Support

The LDM-LIB supported features are listed below which are wrappers into the core ESP-IDF library.

## LDM-Sensor Feature Support

[LDM-Sensors](https://github.com/LilDataMonster/ldm-sensors) provides sensor support to be used with the ESP-IDF as a library. The repository leverages the [LDM-ESP-LIB](https://github.com/UncleRus/esp-idf-lib) which contains support for a variety of sensors for the Espressif devices. The [ESP32-Camera](https://github.com/espressif/esp32-camera) driver is utilized for interfacing with camera sensors. Camera support provides a set of macros to support the pinouts for multiple common ESP devices.

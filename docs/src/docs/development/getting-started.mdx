## Introduction

The development section material describes useful design details related to developing and adding to the open-source code. The code is targeted for the Espressif ESP32 device and assumes the developer has gone through and understands the general ESP-IDF development process and tools. The tutorial and guides to begin working with the ESP-IDF can be found [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/), it is recommended to start here if the developer is not familiar with the ESP-IDF development tools.

To flash the device, the [Getting Started section in Usage](/usage/getting-started), provides the initial code setup to flash the device with the [code](https://github.com/LilDataMonster/loincloth).

The code utilizes two additional libraries, the [LDM-LIB](https://github.com/LilDataMonster/ldm-lib) and the [LDM-Sensors](https://github.com/LilDataMonster/ldm-sensors). The two libraries construct ESP-IDF functions to system and sensors calls.

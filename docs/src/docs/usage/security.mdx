## Introduction

Security is an important part of any system when building and interacting with trusted components. To this end, a variety of security features are built into the ESP-IDF with a handful leveraged in the code.

## SSL/TLS Server Certificates

Over-The-Air (OTA) updates and other HTTP RESTful communication provides support for security certificates. The certificates are stored into memory and used for trust verification when communicating to an external server.

## Flash Encryption

[Flash Encryption](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/security/flash-encryption.html) builds secure firmware compiles. The off-chip memory is encrypted so the physical readout of the chip cannot be recovered. The data encrypted by default is the build's:

- Firmware Bootloader
- Partition Table
- App Partition Builds

TODO: Document support for encryption

## Secure Boot

[Secure Boot](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/security/secure-boot-v1.html) and [Secure Boot V2](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/security/secure-boot-v2.html) provides support for verifying only trusted code will be executed through an RSA/AES verification processes.

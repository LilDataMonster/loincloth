## Introduction

## SSL/TLS Server Certificates

Over-The-Air (OTA) updates and other HTTP RESTful communication provides support for security certificates. The certificates are stored into memory and used for trust verification when communicating to an external server.

TODO: Add how-to for embedding key to build

## Flash Encryption

[Flash Encryption](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/security/flash-encryption.html) builds secure firmware compiles. The off-chip memory is encrypted so the physical readout of the chip cannot be recovered. The data encrypted by default is the build's:

- Firmware Bootloader
- Partition Table
- App Partition Builds

TODO: Document support for encryption

## Secure Boot

[Secure Boot](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/security/secure-boot-v1.html) and [Secure Boot V2](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/security/secure-boot-v2.html) provides support for verifying only trusted code will be executed through an RSA/AES verification processes.

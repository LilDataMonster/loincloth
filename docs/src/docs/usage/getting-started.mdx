## Introduction

The documented setup here is used get a developer up and running quickly implement and deploy the Loincloth software stack onto a device. There are two setup methods to build and flash the ESP32 device which are listed below. The docker setup is the quickest method to setup the device if the user is fairly familiar with docker containers.

1. [Docker Setup](#docker-setup)
2. [Manual Setup](#manual-setup)

Setting up the device in either methods requires performing the following steps:

- Clone external library (used for interfacing with sensors)
- Set target device (ESP32 or ESP32S2)
- Configure device using `idf.py menuconfig` (configuration options described [here](#menu-configuration-options-idfpy-menuconfig))
- Build, flash, and read device output (optional)

---

## Docker Setup

The docker configuration has primarily been tested using a linux OS. The main convenience of using docker is not having the need to install the expressif framework manually, instead the build tools are within a docker container which can be pulled from DockerHub and exposing the device to the container as necessary.

### Dependency Setup

The following dependencies are required in order to compile and target the device.

- ESP-IDF-LIB
  - https://esp-idf-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

```bash
# define location to store dependencies
export WORKSPACE=$HOME

# clone dependencies
cd $WORKSPACE
git clone https://github.com/UncleRus/esp-idf-lib.git

# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/LilDataMonster/loincloth.git --recursive
cd loincloth

# clone xbee_rx
cd $WORKSPACE
git clone https://github.com/LilDataMonster/xbee_rx.git
```

### Pull Build Tools

Use the following command to pull the espressif build tools from DockerHub. Espressif documentation can be found [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/tools/idf-docker-image.html).

```bash
docker pull espressif/idf:release-v4.2
```
---

### Using Docker Scripts

The docker scripts are in place of manually running the docker commands below. They may need slight modification to work properly. Especially in flash.sh, the device is not always at /dev/ttyUSB0. If other USB devices are plugged in, it could be /dev/ttyUSB1 or any other number at the end. Once loincloth is cloned and in your directory, open it and go into docker-scripts and run the following:

```bash
./moveScripts.sh
```
This will move all the scripts for docker into the directory containing loincloth and esp-idf-lib, the $WORKSPACE.
The scripts are testIDF.sh, config.sh, build.sh, and flash.sh.
testIDF.sh is [Running and Exposing the Container](#running-and-exposing-the-container)
config.sh is [Config the Device](#config-the-device)
build.sh is simply building loincloth to show basic compilation debugging
flash.sh is [Flashing the Device](#flashing-the-device)

### Running and Exposing the Container

The container enables the use of a ready-made `idf.py` command but only within the docker container. Since the host does not have direct access to the container, specific pathways into the docker container will need to be exposed for it to be used. A short description of what each docker argument does is provided in the proceeding table. For more information about docker arguments and parameters, checkout the [Docker Reference Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/).

To expose the container to the host, a number of arguments are provided to docker:

```bash
docker run \
        -it \
        --rm \
        --privileged \
        --device /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0 \
        -e LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 \
        -e IDF_LIB_PATH=/esp-lib \
        -v $WORKSPACE/esp-idf-lib:/esp-lib \
        -v $WORKSPACE/loincloth:/project \
        -w /project \
        espressif/idf:release-v4.2 idf.py
```

| Docker Argument                 | Description                                                                                    |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-it`                           | Interactive mode, mainly for using with `menuconfig`                                           |
| `--rm`                          | Remove the container when finished running the command                                         |
| `--privileged`                  | Run as root to avoid permission issues (not particularly needed if permissions setup properly) |
| `--device <host>:<container>`   | Map the device from the host path to a path in the container                                   |
| `-e Key=Value`                  | Defines environment variables within the container                                             |
| `-v <host>:<container>`         | Maps a directory from the host to a path in the container                                      |
| `-w <container path>`           | Set working directory of container's path                                                      |


Once the environment is setup, the steps from [Flashing the Device](#flashing-the-device) can be performed.

---

# Config the Device

To enable sensors, set up wifi, and enable XBee transmission menuconfig must be ran as follows.

```bash
docker run \
        -it \
        --rm \
        --privileged \
        --device /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0 \
        -e LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 \
        -e IDF_LIB_PATH=/esp-lib \
        -v $WORKSPACE/esp-idf-lib:/esp-lib \
        -v $WORKSPACE/loincloth:/project \
        -w /project \
        espressif/idf:release-v4.2 idf.py menuconfig
```

---

# Flashing the Device

Flashing the device can be done using the following steps. The setup is the same for both Docker and the manual setup using the `idf.py` command. In the docker setup, the full `docker run` command must be used with all the appropriate arguments followed by `espressif/idf idf.py` and the corresponding commands below.

For example, to run the commands detailed in [Flash and Monitor](#flash-and-monitor), use the following:

```bash
docker run \
        -it \
        --rm \
        --privileged \
        --device /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0 \
        -e LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 \
        -e IDF_LIB_PATH=/esp-lib \
        -v $WORKSPACE/esp-idf-lib:/esp-lib \
        -v $WORKSPACE/loincloth:/project \
        -w /project \
        espressif/idf:release-v4.2 idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

## Manual Setup

### Dependency Setup

The following dependencies are required in order to compile and target the device.

- ESP-IDF
  - https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/
  - https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/
- ESP-IDF-LIB
  - https://esp-idf-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

To setup the development environment, the espressif build tools must be installed (see espressif's [Getting Started](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html) page). The ESP-IDF environment variables must be set:

| Environment Variable | Description                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|`IDF_PATH`            | ESP-IDF path for the espressif build tools    |
|`IDF_LIB_PATH`        | ESP-IDF-LIB path of the external library      |

```bash
# define location to store dependencies
export WORKSPACE=$HOME

# clone dependencies
cd $WORKSPACE
git clone https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git --recursive
git clone https://github.com/UncleRus/esp-idf-lib.git

# setup environment variables
export IDF_PATH=$WORKSPACE/esp-idf

bash $IDF_PATH/install.sh
source $IDF_PATH/add_path.sh
source $IDF_PATH/export.sh

export IDF_LIB_PATH=$WORKSPACE/esp-idf-lib

# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/LilDataMonster/loincloth.git --recursive
cd loincloth
```

Once the environment is setup, the steps from [Flashing the Device](#flashing-the-device) can be performed.

---


## Set Target Device

Before configuration of the build, setting a device target must be done to indicate what chip is being targeted for the build. The primary two options are the `ESP32` and the `ESP32-S2` device.

To set the target device, run the following for the ESP32:

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32
```

For ESP32-S2 devices, run the following:

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32s2
```

## Configuration

Configuration parameters can be defined using the ESP-IDF configuration menu by executing the following commands and modify custom project configurations within the menu.

```bash
idf.py menuconfig
```

## Build and Compile

Building and compiling the code will begin creating the required binaries for the build and store them in the `build/` folder.

To begin building the code run:

```bash
idf.py build
```

## Flash and Monitor

To flash the build, find the serial location of the device on the host machine (`/dev/ttyUSB0` in this case) and run the `flash` command. Use the `monitor` command to read the serial output of the device. The baudrate is defined in the menu options discussed prior.

```bash
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

---

## Menu Configuration Options (`idf.py menuconfig`)

Custom menu configurations are avaliable to customize various parameters before flashing the firmware. There are 3 customization menus are added which are listed below.

- LDM Library - [LDM-LIB](https://github.com/LilDataMonster/ldm-lib) library adjustable parameters
- LDM Sensors - [LDM-Sensors](https://github.com/LilDataMonster/ldm-sensors) library adjustable parameters

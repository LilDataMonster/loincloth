## Introduction

Bluetooth on the device operates in two modes in accordance to the BLE standard, GAP and GATT modes. The GAP mode advertises the device such that it can be paired with. Once the device is paired with a client, the GATT mode exposes several characteristic attributes that contains device and sensor data. Currently, a bluetooth service is defined for BluFi and another service is defined for LilDataMonster (LDM) services. The BluFi services provices communication to the device to set the WiFi SSID and password in order for the device to connect to the network. The LDM service provices the IP address and MAC address of the device can be retrieved from the device. Additionally the LDM service provides characteristic attributes that contains sensor data if the corresponding sensor was built with the device firmware (currently supports DHT and BME680 sensors).

## Bluetooth Characteristics

The characterstics are customly defined and aren't registered with the Bluetooth SIG. The characteristics and attributes defined are below

### Bluetooth Services

| Bluetooth Service    | UUID                                          |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| BluFi Service        | 0000ffff-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb          |
| LDM Service          | 4c444d00-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb          |

### Bluetooth Characteristics

| BluFi Service                    | UUID                                 | Permissions  |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------|
| BluFi Write Characteristic       | 0000ff01-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb | WRITE        |
| BluFi Read/Notify Characteristic | 0000ff02-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb | READ, NOTIFY |

| LDM Service                      | UUID                                 | Permissions |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| MAC Address Characteristic       | 00004d01-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb | READ        |
| IP Address Characteristic        | 00004d02-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb | READ        |
| DHT Sensor Characteristic        | 00004d03-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb | READ        |
| BME680 Sensor Characteristic     | 00004d04-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb | READ        |

## BluFi Services

The BluFi service is a process to define which WiFi access point for the device to connect to over bluetooth. Details of the BluFi configuration is documented [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/blufi.html).

## LDM Services

The MAC Address characteristic returns 6-bytes that represents the WiFi MAC Address of the device in hex form.

The IP Address characteristic returns 4-bytes that represents the WiFi IP Address of the device when decoded into 4 UINT8 values.

The DHT Sensor characteristic returns 8-bytes that represent the DHT sensor data for the humidity and temperature as 2-float32 values in that order. The data is represented in little-endian.

The BME680 Sensor characteristic returns 16-bytes that represents the BME680 sensor data for the humidity, temperature, pressures, and gas as 4-float32 values in the defined order. The data is represented is in little-endian.

## Device Interface

An example interface used to communicate with the device can be utilized from the page, https://web-ble.lildata.monster which provides bluetooth communications to set WiFi SSID/Password and fetch sensor readings. The web-ble app (beta) is open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/LilDataMonster/web-ble/).

The web-ble interface utilizes the Web-BLE feature avaliable through Google Chrome. The requirement to use the interface only requires Google Chrome to be installed which can be accessed on desktop and mobile platforms. On the desktop Google Chrome app, experimental features must be enabled which is done by accessing the Chrome settings url [chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features](chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features).
